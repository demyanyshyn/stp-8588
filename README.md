# Zen Match: Interactive Single-Page Web Application

## Overview
This is my first commercial project as a frontend developer, built for a client to deliver a modern, user-friendly single-page web application. The project features a clean and responsive interface with interactive elements, including a burger menu, smooth scrolling, and dynamic sliders, ensuring an engaging user experience across all devices.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Built with a Mobile First approach, with breakpoints at 320px and 1200px.
- **Interactive UI**: Includes a burger menu, smooth scrolling, and dynamic sliders powered by GSAP and Swiper.
- **Structured Styling**: Uses SCSS with BEM methodology for maintainable and scalable CSS.
- **Dynamic Functionality**: Leverages JavaScript (ES6+) for real-time content updates and event handling.

## Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for accessibility and structure.
- **SCSS**: Preprocessed CSS with BEM methodology for modular styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles interactivity and DOM manipulation.
- **GSAP**: Enables smooth animations and transitions.
- **Swiper**: Powers dynamic and responsive sliders.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosts the live demo.
